# Travel Info System(Admin Version)
Travel Info System is a simple windows application which serves as a compact travel guide to the users. The whole software is implemented as two applications - 1 at the user side (DBMS) and 1 for administrators.

## For general viewing on github
* The Admin version of the travel info system for dbms project. 
The code that we have done(i.e. backend functionality) is found in the .vb extension files 
Ex:Form1.vb,Homepage.vb. 
* The frontend design is drag and drop and the code is autogenerated it is found in files
Ex: 	Form1.Designer.vb, 	homepage.Designer.vb
All other extension files are autogenerated and not created by us.

## To run 
* To run the apps a local mysql database is necessary.Setup the local database based on the schema mentioned.
* Change the connection string (parameters to connect to your local database) in the code (you might have to change at many places).
* After this, just open the executable file(.exe) at bin/debug/ of respective app folders.
